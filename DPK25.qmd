## ABSTRACT

## Introduction

Dimitrios P. Kontoyiannis is an accomplished clinician-scientist who has made significant contributions to the fields of infectious diseases and medical mycology over the course of his 25-year research career. His expertise spans a broad range of topics and has resulted in numerous influential papers in the fields of fungal pathogenesis, antifungal therapeutics, as well as epidemiological descriptions of every major opportunistic fungal pathogen.

His work has included investigations that elucidated molecular mechanisms of antifungal resistance and biofilm formation in yeast, secondary metabolite production by Aspergillus and inhibition of host angiogenesis, as well as immunoprofiling animal and human host responses to fungal pathogens. His laboratory has excelled in developing both invertebrate and vertebrate animal models for major opportunistic mycoses used in translational research to investigate strategies for optimizing antifungal therapy. These models have provided many new insights into the mechanisms of infection and strategies for optimizing antifungal treatment. Dr. Kontoyiannis\'s group has also published seminal epidemiological studies of major opportunistic fungal pathogens in hemato-oncology patients. His research has provided crucial insights into the prevalence and distribution of fungal diseases, as well as the various organ manifestations encountered in immunocompromised hosts. These epidemiological descriptions have played a vital role in shaping our understanding of these diseases and guiding clinical management.

What distinguishes Dr. Kontoyiannis is not only his broad knowledge and expertise, but also his exceptional creativity and productivity. He has demonstrated an ability to tackle diverse research areas and consistently produce high-impact publications. However, his research

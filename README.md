# Impact of Dimitrios P. Kontoyiannis on Mucormycosis Research and Medical Mycology

Russell E. Lewis Department of Medical Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy

## Introduction

Dimitrios Kontoyiannis is undoubtedly one of the most prolific clinician-scientists in the field of infectious diseases and medical mycology. He has authored or co-authored over 680 publications dealing with topics ranging from the basic biology and pathogenesis of fungal species and antifungal resistance, to the epidemiological studies and diagnosis of rare fungal diseases in immunocompromised hosts, studies of novel drug activity and therapeutic approaches for invasive fungal infections in animal models, and clinical trials of new antifungals in patients. However, invasive mucormycosis holds a special fascination for Dimitrios and is among his most frequently cited work (Table 1)

## Abstract

## Introduction

Dimitrios Kontoyiannis is one of the most prolific clinician-scientists in the field of infectious diseases and medical mycology. Over the last 25 years, he has authored or co-authored over 700 publications addressing topics ranging from basic pathogenesis of fungal diseases and antifungal resistance, to epidemiological descriptions of nearly every major fungal pathogen in cancer patients and clinical trials of novel therapies. Yet his research focusing on rare but devastating infections caused by Mucorales are perhaps the best examples of his scientific creativity and contributions to the field of medical mycology [@tbl-statistics]. 

In this paper, I will review Dimitrios' contributions to our understanding of invasive mucormycosis.
